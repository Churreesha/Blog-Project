        "Lavender (Scientific Name: Lavandula) is one of the most fragrant and highly versatile herbs that you can grow.
        As you may already know, lavender is used in essential oils, perfumes, in aromatherapy, in traditional herbal
        medicine
        and in the kitchen as a culinary herb.
        Here are some other interesting facts about lavender that you may not know:
        The name Lavender comes from the Latin verb, "lavare," which means to wash
        Lavender comes from the same family as mint
        Back in the Elizabethan times, when baths weren't common practice, lavender was used to perfume clothes and bed
        linen
        The scent of lavender deters mice, flies, mosquitoes and other pests from the area
        Lavender oil can be used to soothe aching muscles and joints, reduce anxiety and stress, and to induce sleep"
