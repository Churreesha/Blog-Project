        "1. Peonies actually symbolize good fortune and a happy marriage,
        which is probably why they are a popular addition to wedding flowers.

        2. The peony name actually derives from Greek mythology!
         Paeon was a student of Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine and healing.
         Because Paeon discovered a root that could lessen birth labor pains, Asclepius grew envious of his pupil.
         To protect him from his mentor wrath, Zeus turned Paeon into a peony flower.

        3. In Chinese, the name for the peony is sho-yu, which means “most beautiful”
        Members of the Tang Dynasty of China bred peonies from around 618 to 907 in the imperial courts.
        In the early 11th century, peonies became popular in Japanese culture."
