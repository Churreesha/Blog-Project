    "A cause for much of the mystery surrounding lotus flowers is that they are living fossils.
    Their existence stretches back some 145.5 million years.
    Lotus flowers even survived the Ice Age (1.8 million to 10,000 years ago).
    The Ice Age was a time of great geological and ecological change.
    Most plants in the northern hemisphere became extinct during this era.
    This hardy flower also grows naturally from Russia to Australia, China to Iran.
    It seems they can survive the extremes of any climate.
    These facts have contributed to lotus symbolism in cultures and religions throughout time."
